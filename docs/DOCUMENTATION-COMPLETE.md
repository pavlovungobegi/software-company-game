## 🚀 You're Ready for Phase 2!

### Immediate Next Steps

#### This Week: Verify & Correct
1. **Read ERRATA.md** - Known corrections needed
2. **Verify formulas** - Test against HTML version
3. **Fix experience rate** - Should be 1% not 5%
4. **Update tier definitions** - 5 tiers not 4
5. **Test calculations** - Ensure examples match HTML

#### Next Week: Project Setup
1. **Initialize Next.js 15 project**
2. **Copy state-schema.ts** to `/src/types/game.ts`
3. **Set up Zustand store**
4. **Install dependencies** (lucide-react, vitest)
5. **Create folder structure**

#### Week 2-3: Implement State
1. **Write formula tests** from `formulas.md`
2. **Implement calculations**
3. **100% test coverage**
4. **Game loop implementation**

## 🎓 Learning Resources

### Essential Reading Order
1. **START:** `GETTING-STARTED.md` (15 min)
2. **UNDERSTAND:** `QUICK-REFERENCE.md` (10 min)
3. **DEEP DIVE:** `formulas.md` (30 min)
4. **PLAN:** `MIGRATION-CHECKLIST.md` (20 min)
5. **IMPLEMENT:** Use specific mechanic docs as reference

### Reference During Development
- `state-schema.ts` - Copy-paste types
- `formulas.md` - Calculation reference
- Individual mechanic docs - Detailed logic
- `components.md` - UI building blocks
- `flows.md` - Interaction patterns

---

## 🏆 Success Metrics

When migration is complete:
- ✅ **Zero formula bugs** (100% test coverage)
- ✅ **Feature parity** (everything works)
- ✅ **Clean architecture** (organized code)
- ✅ **Performance** (60fps sustained)
- ✅ **Maintainable** (easy to extend)

---

## ⚠️ Critical Notes

### Must-Read Before Coding
1. **ERRATA.md** - Contains critical corrections
2. **formulas.md** - Source of truth for all math
3. **state-schema.ts** - Structure of all data

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- ❌ Skipping formula tests (this is where bugs hide!)
- ❌ Changing formulas (game balance is tuned)
- ❌ Ignoring edge cases (they're documented for a reason)
- ❌ Adding features before parity (finish migration first)
